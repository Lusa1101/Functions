# 🛠️ Functions Library

Welcome to the **Functions** repository — a curated collection of reusable utility functions designed to streamline development workflows and promote clean, maintainable code.

Whether you're building scalable systems, prototyping AI models, or crafting community-driven tech, these functions are here to save time and reduce repetition.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository serves as a personal toolbox of commonly used functions across various projects. It reflects my commitment to:

- **Efficiency**: Write once, reuse often.
- **Clarity**: Code that’s easy to read, understand, and extend.
- **Ethical Design**: Functions are built with accessibility, modularity, and offline-first principles in mind.
